%description
Soup Sieve is a CSS selector library designed to be used with Beautiful Soup 4.
It aims to provide selecting, matching, and filtering using modern CSS
selectors. Soup Sieve currently provides selectors from the CSS level 1
specifications up through the latest CSS level 4 drafts and beyond (though some
are not yet implemented).

Soup Sieve was written with the intent to replace Beautiful Soup's builtin
select feature, and as of Beautiful Soup version 4.7.0, it now is. Soup Sieve
can also be imported in order to use its API directly for more controlled,
specialized parsing.

Soup Sieve has implemented most of the CSS selectors up through the latest CSS
draft specifications, though there are a number that don't make sense in a
non-browser environment. Selectors that cannot provide meaningful functionality
simply do not match anything.
